Our final project is to implement the othello/reversi into python format.In this project,
we use object-oriented programming the construct the GUI. We also construct the AI
by using the min-max algorithm. We improve its time efficiency by using alpha-beta pruning.
Last, we record the game result and store the information into the text file.

How to use it:
Type the program directory and run the program.
